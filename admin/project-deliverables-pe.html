        <span id="pe-overview">
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The primary objective of the PE is to <mark>increase the rigor of project grading</mark>. Assessing most aspects of the project involves an element subjectivity. As the project counts for 45% of the final grade, it is not prudent to rely on evaluations of tutors alone as there can be significant variations between how different tutors assess projects. That is why we collect more data points via the PE so as to minimize the chance of your project being affected by evaluator-bias.</li>
<li>PE is also <mark>used to evaluate your manual testing skills, product evaluation skills, effort estimation skills</mark> etc.</li>
<li>Note that significant project components are <mark>not graded solely based on peer ratings</mark>. Rather, PE data are mostly used to cross-validate tutors' grades and identify cases that need further investigation. When peer inputs are used for grading, they are usually combined with tutor evaluations with appropriate weight for each. In some cases ratings from team members are given a higher weight compared to ratings from other peers, if that is appropriate.</li>
<li>Note that the PE is <mark>not a means of <em>pitting you against each other</em></mark>. Developers and testers play for the same side; they need to push each other to improve the quality of their work -- not bring down each other.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Grading</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your performance in the practical exam will affect your final grade and your peers', as explained in <a href="/website/admin/project-grading.html"><em>Admin: Project Grading</em></a> section.</li>
<li>As such, we have put in measures to identify and <mark>penalize insincere/random evaluations</mark>.</li>

          <li><mark>Of 3A and 3B above, the one you do better will be given a 70% weight and the other a 30% weight</mark> so that your total score is driven by your strengths rather than weaknesses.</li>
          <li>Bugs rejected by the dev team, if the rejection is approved by the teaching team, will not be affect marks of the tester or the developer.</li>
          <li>The penalty/credit for a bug varies based on,
            <ul>
              <li>The severity of the bug: <code>severity.High</code> &gt; <code>severity.Medium</code> &gt; <code>severity.Low</code> &gt; <code>severity.VeryLow</code></li>
              <li>The type of the bug: <code>type.FunctionalityBug</code> &gt; <code>type.DocumentationBug</code> &gt; <code>type.FeatureFlaw</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The penalty for a bug is divided equally among assignees.</li>
          <li>The developers are not penalized for the duplicate bug reports they received but the testers earn credit for the duplicate bug reports they submitted as long as the duplicates are not submitted by the same tester.</li>
          <li>
            <tooltip content="i.e., the same bug reported by many testers"><em>Obvious</em> bugs</tooltip> earn less credit for the tester and slightly more penalty for the developer.</li>
          <li>If the team you tested has a low bug count i.e., total bugs found by all testers is low, we will fall back on other means <span class="dimmed">(e.g., performance in PE dry run)</span> to calculate your marks for system/acceptance testing.</li>
          <li>Your marks for developer testing depends on the <em>bug density</em> rather than total bug count. Here's an example:
            <ul>
              <li><code>n</code> bugs found in your feature; it is a difficult feature consisting of lot of code → 4/5 marks</li>
              <li><code>n</code> bugs found in your feature; it is a small feature with a small amount of code → 1/5 marks</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>You don't need to find all bugs in the product to get full marks. For example, finding half of the bugs of that product or 4 bugs, whichever the lower, could earn you full marks.</li>
          <li>Excessive incorrect downgrading/rejecting/
            <tooltip content="marking as duplicates">duplicate-flagging</tooltip>, if deemed an unethical attempt to <em>game the system</em>, may be penalized.</li>

  <p>This phase is for you to respond to the bug reports you received.</p>
  <p>Duration: The review period will start around 1 day after the PE (exact time to be announced) and will last until the following <strong>Tuesday midnight</strong>. However, you are recommended to finish this task ASAP, to minimize cutting into your exam
    preparation work.</p>
  <p>Bug reviewing is recommended to be done as a team as some of the decisions need team consensus.</p>
  <box>
    <p><strong>Instructions for Reviewing Bug Reports</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Don't freak out if there are lot of bug reports.</strong> Many can be duplicates and some can be <em>false positives</em>. In any case, we anticipate that all of these products will have some bugs and our penalty for bugs is not harsh. Furthermore,
        it depends on the severity of the bug. Some bug may not even be penalized.</li>

        <box type="info" icon=":fas-hard-hat:">
          <ul>
            <li>CATcher does not come with a UG, but the UI is fairly intuitive (there are tool tips too). Do post in the forum if you need any guidance with its usage.</li>
            <li>Also note that CATcher hasn't been battle-tested for this phase, in particular, w.r.t. multiple team members editing the same issue concurrently. It is ideal if the team members get together and work through the issues together. If you think
              others might be editing the same issues at the same time, use the <code>Sync</code> button at the top to force-sync your view with the latest data from GitHub.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </box>
        <li>Launch CATcher, and login to the profile <code>CS2103/T PE</code>. It will show all the bugs assigned to your team, divided into three sections:
          <ol>
            <li><code>Issues Pending Responses</code> - Issues that your team has not processed yet.</li>
            <li><code>Issues Responded</code> - Your job is to get all issues to the second category.</li>
            <li><code>Faulty Issues</code> - e.g., Bugs marked as duplicates of each other, or causing circular <em>duplicate</em> relationships. Fix the problem given so that no issues remain in this category.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Respond to the bug reports shown.

<p>Issues created for PE-D and PE need to be in a precise format for our grading scripts to work. Incorrectly-formatted responses will have to discarded.

        <li><code>type.FeatureFlaw</code>: Some functionality missing from a feature delivered in v1.4 in a way that the feature becomes less useful to the intended target user for <em>normal</em> usage. i.e., the feature is not 'complete'. In other words,

      <ul>
        <li>If it is not easy to decide the assignee(s), we recommend (but not enforce) that the feature owner should be assigned bugs related to the feature, Reason: The feature owner should have defended the feature against bugs using automated tests and
