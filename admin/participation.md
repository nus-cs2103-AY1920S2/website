{{ thumb("Examples:", "secondary") }}

* Alicia earned 1/2, 3/5, ++2/5++, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 5/5, 4/5, 5/5 in the first 12 weeks. As she received at least half of the points in 11 of the weeks, she gets 5 participation marks. Bonus marks are not applicable as she has full marks already.
* Benjamin managed to get at least half of the participation points in 9 weeks only, which gives him 5-1 = 4 participation marks. But he received good peer ratings for all criteria, and hence get a bonus mark to make it 5/5.
* Chun Ming met the participation points bar in 8 weeks only, giving him 5-2 = 3 marks. He lost 2 more marks because he received multiple negative ratings for two criteria, giving him 1/5 participation marks.

**Participation marks are available in [this page]({{ participation_marks_page }}).**

* The important column is the <span class="text-monospace">==Weeks Count==</span> column. It tells you how many weeks you have met the bar for the criterion <span class="badge badge-info badge-pill">A</span>). Your target is to hit 10 weeks.
* Participation of a week is usually calculated based on two quizzes. For example, week 4 score is calculated based on,
  * `W4-Q1`: previous week's (i.e., lecture 3) in-lecture quiz
  * `W4-Q2`: previous week's (i.e., lecture 3) post-lecture quiz
* Participation bar for weeks 1-3 have been simplified as follows %%(to account for late enrollments, LumiNUS problems etc.)%%:
  * Week 1: submitted pre-module survey or pre-lecture quiz
  * Week 2: submitted at least one of the quizzes
  * Week 3: did reasonably in both quizzes or did well in one of the quizzes
* Quizzes for Week 4 and thereafter are counted as explained in <span class="badge badge-info badge-pill">A</span> above.
