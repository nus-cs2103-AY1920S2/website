              When the first feedback session is opne on TEAMMATES, you will receive an eamil from TEAMMATES. There is nothing for you to do until then.</p>
            <p>When you do receive that email, TEAMMATES will allow you to access it without using a Google login. However, we encourage (but not require) you to login to TEAMMATES using your Google account and complete your profile with a

<h4 id="guidelines-for-giving-peer-feedback">Guidelines for Giving Peer Feedback</h4>
<p>Giving constructive feedback to others is a valuable skill for software engineers. It is also an intended learning outcome of this module. Half-hearted/trivial feedback will not earn participation marks.</p>
<p>Here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume you are giving feedback to a colleague, not a friend. Keep the tone of your feedback reasonably professional. Do not use offensive language or slang.</li>
<li>The feedback should be honest and consistent. Giving positive qualitative feedback (e.g. <code>Thanks for all the hard work!</code> and negative ratings (e.g. <code>Equal share - 40%</code>) to the same team member is not being honest.</li>
<li>State your expectations early. All too often students give positive/neutral feedback early (hoping that the team member will improve later) and trash the team member in the final evaluation (because the he/she did not improve as expected). However, this could be confusing to the recipient. It is better to give negative feedback early so that the team member gets a clear signal that he/she needs to improve.</li></ul></span></div>
