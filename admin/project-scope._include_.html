        <p><strong>Tip: Do <em>all</em> the work related to your enhancement yourself.</strong> <span class="dimmed">Reason:If there is no clear division of who did which enhancement, it will be difficult to divide project credit (or assign responsibility for bugs detected by testers) later.</span></p>

      <li>
        <p><strong>Tip: Divide the components of the product among team members</strong>. Notwithstanding the above, you are still recommended to divide the components of the product among team members so that each team member is <em>in charge</em> of one
          or more components. While others will be modifying those components as necessary for the features they are implementing, your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed">(reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span>          and protect that component from degrading <span class="dimmed">e.g., you can review others' changes to your component and suggest possible changes</span>.</p>
