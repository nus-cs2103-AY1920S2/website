              <p><strong>Guidelines for reviewers</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>If you are new to GitHub PRs, see <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-reviews">GitHub help on how to review PRs</a>.</li>
                <li>Read the blog post <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/07/08/10-tips-for-reviewing-code-you-dont-like/"><strong>10 tips for reviewing code you don’t like</strong></a> - by David Lloyd (a Red Hat developer). In particular,
                  follow the tip about phrasing objections as questions.</li>
                <li>Rather than give one overall comment for the entire PR, add specific comments at relevant places of the code.</li>
                <li>Comment on coding standard violations.</li>
                <li>Feel free to ask for more info from the author, to help you understand the code/design. For example, you can ask why the author chose to write the code in a specific way.</li>
                <li>Feel free to compliment the author when appropriate <span class="dimmed">e.g., <em>hey, I like how clean this bit of code is</em> 👍</span></li>
                <li>You can also suggest alternatives for the author to consider. Feel free to refer back to your own PR if you think a comparison would benefit the author. <mark>You are very welcome to offer to help the author with the project</mark> (in
                  your PR review, or outside of it) if you think the author needs such help i.e., as an informal mentor. Such mentoring will help both the author and you to become stronger programmers.</li>
                <li>You can use Markdown (specifically, <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">GitHub-Flavored Markdown</a>) in your comments.</li>
                <li>At the end of the review, we recommend you to choose <code>Comment</code> (i.e., not <code>Approve</code> or <code>Request changes</code>)</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Guidelines for authors</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Don't get into arguments with reviewers. If you disagree with the reviewer, you can explain your own view in a non-confrontational way without trying to prove your way is better.</li>
                <li>Thank reviewers for their inputs.</li>

                            to get into trouble if you unintentionally reused something copyrighted.</li>
                          <li>You do not violate the license under which the work has been released. Please  <strong>do not use 3rd-party images/audio</strong> in your software unless they have been specifically released to be used freely. Just because you
                            found it in the Internet does not mean it is free for reuse.</li>

                            samples of UG and DG that showcase your documentation skills. Those samples should be understandable on their own. For the parts left-out, you can give an abbreviated version and refer the reader to the full UG/DG for more
                            details.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed">It's similar to giving extra details as appendices; the reader will look at the UG/DG if the PPP is not enough to make a judgment. For example, when judging documentation quality, if the part in the PPP is not well-written, there is no point reading the rest in the main UG/DG. That's why you need to put the most representative part of your writings in the PPP and still give an abbreviated version of the rest in the PPP itself. Even when judging the quantity of work, the reader should be able to get a good sense of the quantity by combining what is quoted in the PPP and your abbreviated description of the missing part. There is no guarantee that the evaluator will read the full document.</span></li>

                        </span> As per <em>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</em>, the input to the app needs to be primarily CLI. The GUI can be used to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. While we don't prohibit non-CLI inputs, note that
                        such inputs will reduce the suitability of the product to target users, which will be graded under the <em>product design</em> criterion.<br> Some suggestions:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Give keyboard alternatives to mouse/GUI inputs, if any.</li>
                          <li>Regular typing is usually faster than using key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse actions or key combinations.</li>
                          <li>
                            <tooltip content="typing the full command and hitting ENTER will complete the task">One-shot commands</tooltip> are faster over
                            <tooltip content="prompting the user to input one parameter at a time">multi-step commands</tooltip>. If you provide a multi-step command to help new users, you can also provide a one-shot equivalent for regular/expert users.<br>
                            <span class="dimmed">Reason: We want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI; having to enter commands part-by-part will slow down the user.</span></li>

                        your role as the <em>in charge</em> of a component is to guide others modifying that component <span class="dimmed">(reason: you are supposed to be the most knowledgeable about that component)</span> and protect that component

                      there is no strong correlation between the LoC and the grade. For instance, in a recent semester, a student who wrote 500 LoC of functional code (i.e., excluding test code and documentation) was able to reach top 20% (in terms of
                      project marks), another who wrote 900 LoC reached the top 10%, while another who wrote more than 5000 LoC ended up in the bottom 10%. Also see the the percentiles of functional LoC written by that batch of students, given below:

                </big>
                </span> As per <em>Constraint-Typing-Preferred</em>, the input to the app needs to be primarily CLI. The GUI can be used to give visual feedback to the user rather than to collect input. While we don't prohibit non-CLI inputs, note that such inputs
                will reduce the suitability of the product to target users, which will be graded under the <em>product design</em> criterion.<br> Some suggestions:
                <ul>
                  <li>Give keyboard alternatives to mouse/GUI inputs, if any.</li>
                  <li>Regular typing is usually faster than using key combinations. Design the app in a way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse actions or key combinations.</li>
                  <li>
                    <tooltip content="typing the full command and hitting ENTER will complete the task">One-shot commands</tooltip> are faster over
                    <tooltip content="prompting the user to input one parameter at a time">multi-step commands</tooltip>. If you provide a multi-step command to help new users, you can also provide a one-shot equivalent for regular/expert users.<br>
                    <span class="dimmed">Reason: We want the user to be able to accomplish tasks faster using CLI than a GUI; having to enter commands part-by-part will slow down the user.</span></li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ul>
                </span>
